##Couple of basic syntaxes

1.source "File path"  -> similar to include other scripts in the current script. Similar to c include

2.set variable_name variable_value -> to create a variable and assign it a Value
  set variable_name -> returns the value of the variable.
  set defines a variable both locally and globally.
  To define a varaible locally(current namespce) use variable 
  variable var_name var_val -> creates a variable in current namespace
  > when trying to access a variable set always take the global value
  > when creating a new variable set creates in current namespace
  > accessing using set after a variable is created using variable, here set points to current namespace, even if global value exists
    varirable var_name var_value
    set var_name
  > variables within procedures have local scope

3.global variable_name -> to use a variable defined globally, variable name binds to the global variable of the same name

4.Procedure definition : Procedures are defined as follows here args is a list of paramters passed to it.
    proc proc_name { args }{
  
    }
    or it can also be like this 
    
    proc proc_name {arg1 arg2}{
    
    }
5.procedure call consists of name of the function followed by the arguments
  proc_name arg1 arg2 arg3 ...
  
6.Variables are substituted in a string with a $ preceding their names. -> $variable_name

7. if block
    
    if { condition }{
    
    }
    
8[E]. strace level - an expect command to tp trace calls. level indiciates the dept hof the call stack to trace 

9. [ script ] - embeds a script to be evalutated, whose result is substituted.

10.String operations- Many different ways exist for string comparision

   >string compare $val "something"  -> true if value is zero, -1/1 based on lexicographic comparsion, can use additional flags to give lenth to compare and ignore case

11[E].Spawn program args - creates a new process running program args , returns the unix process id or 0 is program is not started. 
      Process started by spawn sets the spawn_id , the process referred by spawn_id is called the current_process.
      The process is stopped using close

12. file - is a built in command to manipulate file names and attributes.
   > file tail $name -> returns all the character from last file system component of the val
   > file join $name1 $name2
   
13[E] send_log string - similar to send, sends string to a log_file, ignored if no log file is open

14[E] send string - sends a string to the running process

15[E] log_file [args] -a file - logs into file if name is given, stopes loggining if no oarguemnts are provided.By defaut appends to the file.

16.eval - evaluates a Tcl script

17. open filename [access] [permissions]- opens a file, serial port or command pipeline and returns a channel identifier
    >open filename w+
    
18. fconfigure channelid [name] [value]-set and get options on a channel
    >fconfigure $channelid -buffering line  - flushes everythime an ew line is output
    
    what is a standard channel?
 19.
